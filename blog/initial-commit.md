This is my first post, anywhere. 

## See one, do one, teach one 
I watch a lot of medical shows. 

I think I heard "see one, do one, teach one" on either Grey's Anatomy or ER.
The phrase is used in surgical residency (at least that's what they said in the show), and it represents
a way of learning and solidifying new procedures. I'm not sure why
this phrase is only used in the context of medical residencies because 
it's really applicable for learning anything new. 

I started realizing that I would take time to learn new tools
and frameworks outside of work, and a bit of time would pass
before I would get an opportunity to use my new skills at work.
That meant there was a gap between learning and actually using any new
concepts. Part of my goal with this site is to practice new concepts to 
cement them in my mind before I forget them. One thing I know that
works for me is not only making a practice project to test out
new concepts, but also to explain it in writing, this is where the "teach one"
piece comes into play.

In addition to using this platform as a public repository for my
thoughts on something new or cool that I've come across, I also 
would like to have a place to store and share workflows that 
have worked for me. I started realizing that I keep repeating
steps for scaffolding and initializing projects, and I've often
been asked about some of these workflows at work. Perhaps someone
else would benefit from some of these workflows rather than having to 
reinvent a wheel that's alraedy been...reinvented hudnreds of times
already.
