## Why?
I have had a _lot_ of false starts with making a blog. First, I tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), then 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I took a spin with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
and had multiple tries with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). When I first started looking at Gatsby, it was still a very new project,
so much so that I was apprehensive about committing my time to learning it. This is how long ago I started the process
of trying to write a blog.

My initial motivation for putting together a blog was to have a place to share data projects I was interested in 
dabbling with. This was before I started a fulltime dev job, and I thought I'd have a lot of time on my hands.
Needless to say, I did not have a lot of time on my hands after I started my current job. A few years in, I finally
have some interesting things to say. I've developed some of my own patterns and workflows, and I have better idea
about how what I thought disparate technologies actually work really well together (i.e. Docker, haha).

Now that I had some actual content I felt I could use to fill up a site, I had more motivation to put together a blog,
or at least try to _one last time_.

## Why NextJS?
This is a good question. I mentioned I had looked at a few other static site generators. I might do a more
in-depth review of different static generators at a later time, but for now, my answer is just that NextJS was new
and it kind of stuck. I particularly liked how easy it was to deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). One of my
interests is to get a better intuition for deployment, and since Vercel basically makes deployment seamless and transparent,
I wanted to work with their workflow to develop my own at some point.

On this note, I did find that different static site generators can offer you an opportunity to learn something
specific to their system. For instance, Gatsby uses GraphQL, so developing your site with Gatsby might be worth it
if you'd like to learn GraphQL in the process. 

import InterSiteLink from "../../components/styled-components/InterSiteLink" 

## The basic workflow I used
1. <InterSiteLink text={'Develop a design for this blog: I used Sketch'} to={'/blog/next-js-dev-part-1'} />
2. Work through the NextJS tutorial
3. Make my own project using what I learned from the tutorial
4. Initialize the project with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to speed up component design
5. Flesh out the next js scaffolding to work the way I wanted it to
6. Deploy

## How I've organized my posts
A basic tenet of solving a problem or building something is to break it down into digestible parts. I think as a whole,
a project like this can be confusing and overwhelming, but breaking it down into the steps I outlined can help you 
not only make a blog, but also understand what's happening at each step. Understanding each step is...well...the point
of a project like this. Most of my professional work is sequestered to one side of the project, i.e. the frontend, so 
even I stood to learn something from working on this project. A lot of thought has been put into these frameworks
by their creators, and understanding what's going on under the hood can really unlock the potential of technologies
like NextJS.
