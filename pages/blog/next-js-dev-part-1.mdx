It can be overwhelming to figure out where to start when putting together a project like this,
so a good first step is to start with organizing your project. In this case, I started with
putting together a UI mockup of how I wanted this blog to look. Putting together a UI mockup
helps organize the project by:
* figuring out which components should be reusable
* how routing should behave
* giving me time and space to focus on aesthetics, which I can use as a reference later while coding

Separating the project into phases helps isolate each of the dev processes. For instance,
while working on a design (in Sketch, Figma, etc) gives the developer a chance to focus
just on an app's aesthetics as well as a way to set expectations on how it should behave.
Thinking of the design at a high level like this can help ensure that your app flows
in an intuitive way because you're taking the perspective of a user during this phase.

## How I designed my components

import CenteredImage from "../../components/styled-components/CenteredImage"

<CenteredImage caption={"A screenshot of my Recent Posts page sketch"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-1/recent-posts.png' alt='recent posts screenshot' width='500px'/>
</CenteredImage>

I used [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) ($99/year as of this post) to develop my mockups, but some other options are [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
which has a free tier, and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 

Breaking the design I had in my head down into components helped me think about how I would organize my code.
For instance, if I found myself copying and pasting a component in my Sketch mockup, I knew it would be reusable.
The manual modifications I would make to my copy/pasted element represent the data I would supply to my reusable
component as a prop.

## Thinking ahead and routing considerations
In addition to thinking about what components you will need in your blog, developing the mockup can clear up
ideas around routing. For instance, I know that in addition to my "Recent Posts" page, I know I want to show
all of my blog posts on a page with the title "Blog", and I want to do the same on a "Projects" page.

<CenteredImage caption={"My other two pages from my sketch mockup"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-1/blog-screenshot.png' alt='blog posts screenshot' width='500px'/>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-1/projects-screenshot.png' alt='projects page screenshot' width='500px'/>
</CenteredImage>

This means that at _minimum_, I need 3 paths with static routes:
1. `/` or my main index/home page
2. `/blog` for my blog index page
3. `/projects` for my projects index page

### Static vs dynamic routes
I mentioned that these are _static_ routes. What do I mean by that? Static routes are routes that don't
need a parameter of any kind. There is only one "blog index". Compare this to a _dynamic_ route, which would
take a parameter of some kind. For instance, each blog page might have a route with the structure `/blog/[id]` where
the `id` parameter specifies which blog page I want to access. For instance, going to `/blog/my-first-blog-post` should
route to a page with the id `my-first-blog-post`.

## Trust me, this step is worth it
First of all, this step is supposed to be _fun_ as well as satisfying. The way your blog or app looks is the first impression
people will get from it. Having a cohesive and polished design gives the impression that you take your
app seriously. You may spend hours trying to make things work under the hood, so why not reflect this effort
on the surface by having a consistent and clean aesthetic?

Creating a mockup is like creating a map for your project. When you start to understand how NextJS works,
having a mockup like this can help apply some context to the NextJS functionality that you'll learn about. 
All of the reputable static site generators have tutorials to guide a user through the setup process, but 
they're all a bit nuanced. It can be difficult to understand which parts you need to pay attention to,
or why the developers of the project added a specific feature to their framework. Being able to reframe
the concepts from the docs or the tutorial project in terms of your own project can help solidify your understanding
of the static site generator you choose to go with.
