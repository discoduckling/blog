title: 'NextJS Workflow Part 3: Setting Up the Project'
date: '2020-07-19'
blurb: "It's finally time to start our project. While the NextJS tutorial provides a comprehensive example of how to set
up a project, I found that the setup I came up with varied slightly from the tutorial. In retrospect, these steps make total
sense and are not difficult to understand, but it did take a while to figure out how to set up my project the way I 
wanted to."

It's finally time to get started on the actual project! The [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) docs are pretty comprehensive so I won't go
too deep into all of the config options available. I'll focus on the steps I took to set up this site.

## 1. Initialize the project directory
Once in the  directory where the project will live, run the NextJS command to initialize a NextJS project:
```shell script
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```
The above was taken directly from the "Getting Started" section of the NextJS docs. They outline steps for a manual setup
as well, but the automatic method worked for me and I recommend using it.

As part of the initialization process, the script will ask you for a project name (I called mine `example-blog`). This will
be the name of the directory that will hold your project. Then, the script will ask if it should use a default template
or an example project from the Next.js repo. For this project, I will use the default template because I want to build
most of it from the base layer.

The script will run through the rest of the initialization steps on its own, and will output instructions at the very
end on how to run your project:
```shell script
cd example-blog
yarn dev
```
So let's do that.

import CenteredImage from "../../components/styled-components/CenteredImage"

<CenteredImage caption={"The basic starter home page"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-3/basic_starter_index_page.png' alt='basic home page' width='500px'/>
</CenteredImage>

So far, so good.

## 2. Setting up the project file structure
Open up the project in an IDE and take a look at the default project structure.
```text
.
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── api
│   │   └── hello.js
│   └── index.js
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── vercel.svg
└── yarn.lock
```

As I mentioned in my previous post, NextJS bases its routing structure off of the file structure of the `pages/` 
subdirectory. Plus, NextJS assumes that it should render the file at the `pages/index.js` when a user navigates
to the `/` route (or the site's home page). 

Editing the `index.js` page will change what's displayed on the site's current home page. So let's try that. Open up
`pages/index.js` and replace all of the text with 
```js
import React from "react";

const Home = (props) => {
    return <div>This is my home page!</div>
}

export default Home;
```

Now, the home page should look like this:
<CenteredImage caption={"The `/` after a basic edit."}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-3/hello_world_home.png' alt='edited home page' width='500px'/>
</CenteredImage>

For now, the simplest way to think about the static route pages is as React components. For instance,
`index.js` will have a default export, in this case we called that default export `Home`. This component
is what will be displayed when `/` is accessed. This becomes a little more complicated when I go into
the dynamically routed pages which is why I'm only focusing on the statically routes pages for now.

### A refresher on the floorplan for this site
In my previous post, I mentioned that I want to be able to navigate to the following routes:
* `/`: the home page, where I will show my recent additions, which can include a mix of blog posts, projects, and workflows
* `/blog`: this is where I'll show only posts that I've tagged as "blog" posts
* `/projects`: here, I'll show any projects I've created (I haven't made any yet)
* `/workflows`: one of the things I know I want to showcase on this site is a repository of workflows that I use
in my dev work. I haven't exactly figured out how I want to structure those, but they will live here

Now that I know how I want the site to behave, I can structure my project files to be mapped to these routes. NextJS
will do this mapping behind the scenes, and if we get the project structure right, it should all work like charm.

### Mapping my routes to a file structure
As I outlined above, I know what statically-routed pages I want. NextJS will expect these pages to be available in the
`pages/` subdirectory, just like the `index.js` file that was put there during the initialization step. So we can
add a `js` file for each of these pages:
```shell script
cd pages
touch blog.js projects.js workflows.js
```

Now, in the body of each of these `js` files, we have to add a default export that is a component that will be rendered
when we navigate to each of these routes. The route "name" (i.e. `/projects` or `/blog`) will be generated based on the
file name. Therefore, it's important to name the file the same name you expect to use in the url. Less important
is the name of the component used as the default export in each of these files. Eventually, we will be using a
shared layout between all of these components. For now, add this to the body of each of the files we just made:

```js
import React from "react";

const Page = (props) => {
    return <div>This is the "insert page name here" page</div>
}

export default Page;
```

Now, to test it out, navigate to `localhost:3000/blog`, `localhost:3000/projects`, or `localhost:3000/workflows`. You should see the text
we included in the `Page` component we exported from the body of each of these files.

### Nested routes
I'm more than happy to give up my routing configuration to NextJS. This is particularly convenient when we start
becoming interested in nested routes, i.e. `localhost:3000/blog/blog_post_1`. When NextJS sees a subdirectory in the
`pages/` directory, it will know to use a nested route to render the files in the subdirectory. For instance,
`pages/blog/blog_post_1.js` will be the source of content for the `/blog/blog_post1` route. To test this out,
let's make a subdirectory called `blog` and add a file there. Then we can access the nested route to make sure routing
is working the way we expect it to:
First, make the subdirectory inside the `pages/` directory: 
```shell script
# inside pages/
mkdir blog
```
Then, create the dummy file that we will use to render content at the nested route:
```shell script
touch blog/blog_post_1.js
```

Edit the contents of `blog_post_1.js` to this:
```js
import React from "react";

const ExampleBlogPost = () => {
    return <div>Example Blog Post</div>
}

export default ExampleBlogPost;
```

Finally, if we navigate to `/blog/blog_post_1`, we should see the text "Example Blog Post". It's underwhelming,
but now we know that our file structure is being mapped to our site's route the way we expect it to.

### (Optional) Setting up Prettier and ESLint
I say this is optional, but I don't actually *believe* that. In my mind, using Prettier and ESLint is a necessity
for any Javascript project. The following steps are what I use for any npm-initialized project. Since we've already
started adding some React code, now would be a good time to implement code formatting into this project.

Start by creating `.prettier.js` and `.eslintrc.js` files in the root of your project.
```shell script
# from the project root
touch .prettierrc.js .eslintrc.js
```

Then, add the config info to each of these files. These will
be exported from the files to be used by the parsers we will add:
`.prettierrc.js`
```js
module.exports = {
    arrowParens: "avoid",
    parser: "babel",
    trailingComma: "none",
    singleQuote: false
};
```
`.eslintrc.js`
```js
module.exports = {
    extends: "react-app",
    plugins: ["prettier"],
    rules: {
        "prettier/prettier": "error"
    }
};
```

Next, we need to install the necessary packages to make
our code formatting work:
```shell script
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

The last step for prettier + eslint setup will be to add
eslint config information to the project's `package.json`:
```json
"eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app"
}
```

Finally, to run prettier on a file, I open it up in my IDE (I 
use Webstorm) and run `⌘ + ⌥ + ⇧ + P`, and I breathe a sigh of 
relief as my slightly ugly code gets prettified.

## 2. Injecting props
The site we're working on isn't particularly interesting right now. Take, for instance,
the `/blog`, `/projects`, and `/workflows` routes. They all display
the same content: `This is the "insert page name here" page`. The `insert page name here` would be a great place
to insert some dynamic information! In this case, it would be great to be able to get the page name from
props sent to the page. However, we don't use redux in this project, so there is no central state, so to speak.
As an alternative, NextJS tells us to create a function named `getStaticProps` in the file for the page
we are trying to inject with props. For this project, I will be using static generation rather than server-side
generation to pre-render my pages. The NextJS docs go into more detail on the difference between the two, but it is
recommended to use static generation.

This convention, creating a function named `getStaticProps` seems weird in the beginning, but its kind of like using
`mapStateToProps` + the redux `connect()` function.

To test this out, we can add this function to the end of the `pages/blog.js` file:
```js {5,6,11-17}
// blog.js
import React from "react";

const Page = (props) => {
    const { title } = props;
    return <div>This is the {title} page</div>
}

export default Page;

export async function getStaticProps() {
    return {
        props: {
            title: "blog"
        }
    };
}
``` 
The highlighted lines are the ones that were changed to bring in props to the default export from `blog.js`.
Comparing lines 5 and 14, we can see where to name a prop in the `getStaticProps` function and how it translates
to the props received by the default export in this file. Although this is a trivial example (and in fact, using
dynamic routes here might make some sense), it's good enough to illustrate how to get props into a statically
generated page. Now, if we navigate to `/blog`, the text should read `This is the blog page`. Hopefully, you can
start to see some patterns and how we can create reusable components to be used in these static pages. For instance,
we can create a reusable component that takes the "title" as a prop, and the reuse that component in all of these
static pages we've been working on.

# Adding Content
## Parsing MDX
This next step ended up taking me much longer than I thought it would because I didn't understand how
data from markdown files got passed to a page with a dynamic route. Here's a breakdown of the steps I'll go through
to get this project working with `.mdx` files.
1. create some blog posts for testing
2. set up configuration to work with `.mdx` files
3. make a layout that will be used for wrapping the content from `.mdx` files. I'll be focused on "blog" posts.
6. connect `.mdx` files to our layout wrapper

These are a lot of steps, and this is easily the hairiest part of this project. This process reminds me of setting up
redux, because it's hard to figure out what the linear path is. Do we create sample data first? Or do we set up the
infrastructure we need to parse the sample data? The steps I outlined above were *not* the steps I actually used when
I was setting up this site because I was just throwing stuff at the wall to get my `.mdx` parsed correctly. In retrospect,
the steps outlined above are the ones I would take if I knew what I was doing. 

## 3. Add sample blog posts to work with
At this point, I'm not sure how the infrastructure will work, but I know how I want it to work.
* the "starting point": add `.mdx` posts in the `pages/blog/` directory
* the "ending point": the data from the `.mdx` files should be available via nested routes, i.e. the file `pages/blog/blog_post_1.md`
should be shown when I navigate to the route `/pages/blog/blog_post_1`.

Add a few sample blog post files to `pages/blog/`:
```shell script
# in pages/blog/
touch first-post.mdx second-post.mdx third-post.mdx
```
And to each of these files, add some frontmatter and body content. Specifically, make sure there's a field of
frontmatter data called `title`:
```markdown
---
title: 'My first post'
---

This is where I talk about my first post.

<div style={{ color: "orange", fontSize: 25 }}>Hello world!</div>
```

I've added some jsx code to the end of the file. This is the purpose of using `.mdx` instead of `.md` files. We can embed
jsx code directly into these markdown files. 

Right now, if you navigate to `/blog/first-post` (remember, NextJS takes the file name and uses it to make a nested
route), you will be redirected to a 404 page. We haven't added any configuration to parse `.mdx` data yet, so it makes
sense that this route isn't working yet. Hopefully, it will one day.

As of this point, you should have three sample `.mdx`-formatted blog posts in the `pages/blog/` directory.

## 4. Add configuration to work with mdx files 
The easiest way to get your NextJS project working with mdx is to use `next-mdx-enhanced`. This is a plugin
for NextJS that will parse the `.mdx` files in your project and it will also parse frontmatter from `.mdx`
files.

Install the package:
```shell script
npm install --save next-mdx-enhanced
```

Add the following to your `.gitignore` file:
```gitignore
...
.mdx-data/
...
```

Next, we need to add a `next.config.js` file to the project's root directory. The content of the config
file should look like this:
```js {4,5}
const withMdxEnhanced = require('next-mdx-enhanced')

module.exports = withMdxEnhanced({
  layoutPath: 'components/page-layouts',
  defaultLayout: false,
  fileExtensions: ['mdx'],
  remarkPlugins: [],
  rehypePlugins: [],
  extendFrontMatter: {
    process: (mdxContent, frontMatter) => {},
    phase: 'prebuild|loader|both',
  },
})({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
})
```

In line 4, the plugin needs to know where in the project structure it should look for the layouts it will use
to wrap mdx content. In line 5, I've set the `defaultLayout` to false because I don't want the plugin to use
a default layout when I don't specify one. 

## 5. Add a layout for the blog posts we wrote
Speaking of layouts, we need to make some. For now, we'll just make a file to hold this code, and we'll
populate it later. Since I specified a directory for these layouts in `next.config.js`, let's make a
directory and layout file at that location.

From the project's root directory:
```shell script
mkdir components
mkdir components/page-layouts
touch components/page-layouts/BlogPostLayout.js
```

Now that the layout file (`BlogPostLayout.js`) has been created, we can edit it to accept the props
that the `next-mdx-enhanced` plugin will inject into it. This is what the content of `BlogPostLayout.js`
should look like after you edit it:
```js {3,4}
import React from "react";

const BlogPostLayout = frontMatter => {
  return ({ children: content }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <div style={{ color: "red" }}>{frontMatter.title}</div>
        <div style={{ color: "green" }}>{content}</div>
      </div>
    );
  };
};

export default BlogPostLayout;
```
The docs for `next-mdx-enhanced` are available [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced). 

The docs say that the plugin provides a file's frontmatter data as a parameter to the default export from this layout.
We will eventually connect this layout component to our mdx file, which is how the plugin will know to provide
this parameter to this specific component. The plugin expects this export to return a function that will
render the layout we are interested in using. *That* render function receives the content of the `.mdx` file
as a prop named `children`.

In this sample layout, the title should appear red, and the content should appear green. Additionally,
we had inserted some jsx code into the `first-post.mdx` file. This text, `Hello World!`, should appear orange.

Recap: 
1. We configured the plugin we need to parse mdx
2. We created a layout to use in our `.mdx` blog post files

What's left to do:
3. Connect this layout file to our `.mdx` blog post files
4. Test it out

## 6. Connect the `.mdx` files we created to the layout we want to use to render them
To connect the `.mdx` files we created to the `BlogPostLayout.js` layout component, edit the frontmatter
of the blog post files we created by adding the highlighted line:

```markdown {3}
---
title: 'My first post'
layout: 'BlogPostLayout' 
---
...
```

Here, we are telling `next-mdx-enhanced` which layout file we want to use (from the `components/page-layouts/` directory)
as the layout for these `.mdx` files.

Make sure to restart your server before testing out the nested routes. Changes to `next.config.js` require
server restarts.

Navigating to `localhost:3000/blog/first-post` should now show something like this:
<CenteredImage caption={"`/blog/first-post` with mdx!"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-3/mdx-test.png' alt='rendrered mdx' width='500px'/>
</CenteredImage>

You should also be able to navigate to `/blog/second-post` and `/blog/third-post` to see the content
from `second-post.mdx` and `third-post.mdx` files. We have nested routing working, as well as mdx parsing!

# Final thoughts on this section
The `next-mdx-enhanced` plugin does a lot of work for us. It automatically parses the grey matter and the
front matter of our `.mdx` posts. It makes it easy to specify a layout for individual `.mdx` files. And
it makes it easy to inject front matter and grey matter into the layout components we define using React.
