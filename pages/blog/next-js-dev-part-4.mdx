<div style={{color: 'blue'}}>Building a NextJS Blog: Part 4</div>

The project file structure has been organized in a NextJS-friendly way, and we can now rest assured that
routing will work the way we expect it to. The next steps are to flesh out this site with React components
so it looks a little bit better than it currently does. In order to do that, I prefer to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## What is Storybook?
Storybook is a dev tool for speeding up the process of developing React components. Once installed integrated into
your React project, it can be used to take components directly from your project and create a separate "playground"
for fleshing out these components. I almost always use storybook when I'm working on a new feature of a large
React project because it allows me to focus solely on the feature at a component level. Furthermore, I've found
that Storybook encourages "separation of concerns" when it comes to isolating the functionality of a component
from the data it needs. This, in turn, leads to the development of more modular or atomic pieces of code that
can be separated from their data sources, making them reusable.

Another advantage of Storybook is very fast hot reloading. When I'm working with a complex UI, running in Docker, with
many process running to support it, hot reloading the UI takes time. Even if it's a matter of seconds, those seconds
become very noticeable when I'm working on simply improving css or responsiveness of a component. Isolating the
components from the rest of the UI using Storybook helps speed up the iterative process of component development.

# Dev Setup
## Installing Storybook
Storybook has plenty of [instructions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react/) on how to automatically or manually install Storybook into
a project. Basically, the automatic way to get Storybook working in your NextJS project is to run the
following command from the root of the project:
```shell script
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
```
This initialization process will create two directories, `stories` and `.storybook` in the root of the project.
We will be writing our stories in the `stories` directory. Storyboook customizations are often added to the
`storybook` directory.

## Component Development Roadmap: Deciding what components we need and writing stories for them
Now that Storybook has been installed, it's a good time to outline the components we might need for the blog.
A good starting list would be:
1. a nav bar of some kind to navigate between pages (`<NavBar />`)
2. page title (`<PageTitle />`)
3. post title (`<PostTitle />`)
4. date label (`<DateLabel />`)
5. summary component (to show list of blog posts) (`<PostOverview />`)
5. a general layout for all the pages (`<OverviewLayout />`) 
6. layout for a blog post (`<BlogPostLayout />`)

## Installing Emotion for inline styling
NextJS has support for css modules right out of the box for styling individual components, but I prefer
using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for inline styling. So I'll start by installing this 
package into my project:
```shell script
npm i @emotion/core
```

## Organizing the new components
I'm also going to make a directory called `styled-components` to house all of my custom components for this project:
```shell script
mkdir components/styled-components
```

The `components` directory should look like this now:
```text {2,3}
components
├── page-layouts
│   └── BlogPostLayout.js
└── styled-components
```
Remember, we had made a `BlogPostLayout` component in the previous section to test out the site.

# Beginning the component development process

## Creating the components
I highlighted some components above that would be a good starting point for this blog. I'll start by creating
files for these components:
```shell script
cd components/styled-components
touch NavBar.js Text.js PostOverview.js
cd ../page-layouts
touch OverviewLayout.js
```

I've already created a component for the blog post layout, so I didn't need to do that here. 
I also decided to house all of the text components 
(`PageTitle`, `PostTitle`, and `DateLabel`) in the same file called `Text.js`.

## Initializing the stories for the new components
My usual process is to create a different story file for each of the components. Within each story file, you 
can define different stories depending on the different states of the component being described in the file.
For this project, this means creating 7 stories:
```shell script
cd stories
touch 2-NavBar.stories.js 3-PageTitle.stories.js 4-PostTitle.stories.js 5-DateLabel.stories.js
touch 6-PostOverview.stories.js 7-OverviewLayout.stories.js 8-BlogPostLayout.stories.js
```

The reason I started with `2` instead of `0` with my `NavBar` story file is because Storybook
initializes this directory with two example stories: `0-Welcome.stories.js` and `1-Button.stories.js`. I like
leaving these stories in, especially if you've never used Storybook before, because they can be a good reference
for how to write stories.

I will walk through the process of creating a story for the `NavBar` component for the sake of brevity.
Although you don't have to use Storybook for your development process, I highly recommend it.

### Writing a story for `<NavBar />`
As a placeholder for now, I'll add the following code to the body of `NavBar.js` so I have a default export
to play with in `2-NavBar.stories.js`.
```js
import React from "react";

const NavBar = () => {
  return <div>NavBar</div>;
};

export default NavBar;
```

Then, in `2-NavBar.stories.js`, I'll add the following code to create my first story:
```js
import React from "react";
import NavBar from "../components/styled-components/NavBar";

export default {
  title: "NavBar",
  component: NavBar
};

export const BasicExample = () => {
  return <NavBar />;
};
```
Now, if you run `yarn storybook` and navigate to `localhost:6006`, you should see 3 stories, including the `NavBar` story:
import CenteredImage from "../../components/styled-components/CenteredImage"

<CenteredImage caption={"NavBar story wired in"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-4/navbar_story_1.png' 
        alt='navbar story beginning' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

## Fleshing out the `<NavBar />`
For now, I'm only going to put a link to the home page (`/` route) in the nav bar. 

I added the following code to `NavBar.js`:
```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, css } from "@emotion/core";

const NavBarLink = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        font-size: 20px;
        text-decoration: underline;
        font-weight: bold;
        cursor: pointer;
        color: white;
      `}
    >
      {text}
    </div>
  );
};

const NavBar = () => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        padding-left: 20px;
        height: 60px;
        background-color: DodgerBlue;
      `}
    >
      <NavBarLink text={"Home"} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default NavBar;
```

And now, choosing the NavBar story in storybook should look like this:
<CenteredImage caption={"NavBar after some basic styling"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-4/navbar_story_2.png' 
        alt='navbar story beginning' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

## Creating the `<PostOverview />` component
I started by first creating the titles I'll need in `Text.js`:
```js
// Text.js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, css } from "@emotion/core";

export const PostTitle = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        font-size: 24px;
      `}
    >
      {title}
    </div>
  );
};

export const PageTitle = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        font-size: 40px;
        text-decoration: underline;
        color: DodgerBlue;
      `}
    >
      {title}
    </div>
  );
};

export const DateLabel = ({ date }) => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        color: gray;
      `}
    >
      {date}
    </div>
  );
};
```

I'll create `<PostOverview />` by putting these components together:
```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, css } from "@emotion/core";
import { DateLabel, PostTitle } from "./Text";

const PostOverview = ({ title, date }) => {
  return (
    <div css={css`
      height: 70px;
    `}>
      <PostTitle title={title} />
      <DateLabel date={date} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default PostOverview;
```

I start with the smallest components and use that to cobble together the larger ones.
Now that I have this `<PostOverview />` component ready, I can use it in my Storybook
story to mock up an example home page where I show all of my posts. The next
component to work on will be `<OverviewLayout />`.

## Constructing the main layout: `<OveviewLayout />`
At this point, the only common things I want to show on all of my pages is the `NavBar` and
the page title. Therefore, I'll include it in these in my common layout component. I'll also 
add some styling to make all of my pages look consistent (i.e. consistent padding). Consistency
between components will of course make the site as a whole look more polished, but it will also
help make the code "DRY"-er. By thinking of common code between components, we can more this code
higher up in the tree to make sure that we can reuse it wherever necessary. This helps keep code
duplication to a minimum.

I edited `OverviewLayout.js` to look like this:
```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, css } from "@emotion/core";
import NavBar from "../styled-components/NavBar";
import { PageTitle } from "../styled-components/Text";

const OverviewLayout = props => {
  const { pageTitle } = props;
  return (
    <div>
      <NavBar />
      <div
        css={css`
          padding: 20px 40px;
        `}
      >
        <PageTitle title={pageTitle} />
        <div
          css={css`
            margin-top: 30px;
          `}
        >
          {props.children}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default OverviewLayout;
```

## Updating `<BlogPostLayout />`
Now that we have finished making an `<OverviewLayout />` component, this can be reused in 
`<BlogPostLayout />` to maintain consistency.

This is the current version of `BlogPostLayout.js`, as defined in the previous post:
```js {7,8}
import React from "react";

const BlogPostLayout = frontMatter => {
  return ({ children: content }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <div style={{ color: "red" }}>{frontMatter.title}</div>
        <div style={{ color: "green" }}>{content}</div>
      </div>
    );
  };
};

export default BlogPostLayout;
```

We know that `<OverviewLayout />` will take the title as a prop, and we can put the content
this component gets from `next-mdx-enhanced` in the content of `OverviewLayout`. So we can change
this component to look like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import OverviewLayout from "./OverviewLayout";

const BlogPostLayout = frontMatter => {
  return ({ children: content }) => {
    return (
      <OverviewLayout pageTitle={frontMatter.title}>{content}</OverviewLayout>
    );
  };
};

export default BlogPostLayout;
```

At this point, if you run `yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:3000/blog/first-post`,
the sample blog post page should look like this:
<CenteredImage caption={"The revamped blog page"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-4/navbar_story_3.png' 
        alt='updated blog layout' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

# Next Steps
In the next post, I'll talk about wiring in these components to our NextJS site. After that,
we'll be ready to *finally* deploy!
