<div style={{color: 'blue'}}>Building a NextJS Blog: Part 5</div>

We've created the scaffolding for our project, set up Storybook integration for rapid
iteration, and create custom components for this blog. It's finally time to put it all together.

## Get the nav bar to show up on all the pages
By the end of the last post, we had created a simple nav bar and connected it to the blog post layout:

import CenteredImage from "../../components/styled-components/CenteredImage"

<CenteredImage caption={"/blog/first-post"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-5/blog_first_post.png' 
        alt='/blog/first-post' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

However, there are a couple more things we need to do to make this nav bar useful:
1. add it to the home page
2. wire the nav link to routing

### Adding the nav bar to the home page
We have already added this nav bar component to our `OverviewLayout.js`, which we should
use for all of the pages on this site in order to standardize the layout on all of the 
site's pages. This is the advantage of using layouts, we don't need to reinvent the 
wheel each time for each page and it gives us a single source to tweak the layout
for every page on the site.

Before, tweaking `index.js` to use `OverviewLayout.js`, here's a reminder of the current
state of `index.js`:
```js
import React from "react";

const Home = (props) => {
    return <div>This is my home page!</div>
}

export default Home;
```

Pretty basic. For now, let's keep the `div` with the text as the main content of this page (
this will change once we wire in static props to the home page). Bringing in the layout file,
`index.js` will now look like this:
```js
import React from "react";
import OverviewLayout from "../components/page-layouts/OverviewLayout";

const Home = props => {
  return (
    <OverviewLayout>
      <div>This is my home page!</div>
    </OverviewLayout>
  );
};

export default Home;
```
Since we are using the same parent template for both the home page and the blog posts,
the nav bar should be rendered on both types of pages:
<CenteredImage caption={"The new home page with nav bar"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-5/home_navbar.png' 
        alt='`/` with nav bar' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

### Wiring in the nav link 
Currently, clicking on `/Home` in the nav bar doesn't do anything. Ideally, clicking on this
link will take the user back to the home page.

As I've mentioned before, an advantage of using a static site generator, like NextJS, is that we
don't need to necessarily set up routing. NextJS handles this for us. However, since NextJS is doing
the complicated routing behind the scenes, we need to use their "link" component that is already
set up to work with their routing system. NextJS provides a `Link` export from `next/link` that
we can use in our nav bar to make navigation function as intended.

To implement nav functionality in the nav bar, we'll need to tweak `NavBar.js`:
```js {2,4,15,31}
...
import Link from "next/link";

const NavBarLink = ({ text, to }) => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        font-size: 20px;
        text-decoration: underline;
        font-weight: bold;
        cursor: pointer;
        color: white;
      `}
    >
      <Link href={to}>{text}</Link>
    </div>
  );
};

const NavBar = () => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        padding-left: 20px;
        height: 60px;
        background-color: DodgerBlue;
      `}
    >
      <NavBarLink text={"Home"} to={"/"}/>
    </div>
  );
};
...
```

I've modified the highlighted lines. The `Link` component supplied by NextJS takes an `href`
attribute. The value of`href` is just the route that the link should direct to. In this case,
clicking on the 'Home' link should redirect the user to the home page. Since I'm trying to keep
things as flexible as possible, I'm supplying the value for `href` via a prop in `NavBarLink` (see line
31). This way, I can add more links to the nav bar and add routes as I go. 

Now, to test this, if we navigate to `/blog/first-post`, we should be able to click on the "Home" link,
and be directed back to the home page. One way navigation back to the home page works! But, how can
we get to the blog post via links?

### Adding dates to the blog posts
Up until now, the front matter for our sample blog posts have been pretty simple:
```markdown
---
title: 'My first post'
layout: 'BlogPostLayout'
---
```

In order to sort the data by date, I need to add a date to the front matter:

```markdown
---
title: 'My first post'
layout: 'BlogPostLayout'
date: '2020-07-01'
---
```

## Show all posts on the home page: injecting static props
We need a way to connect the home page to data on all available blog posts. As a new post is added
to the project, it will be added to the home page as a link. To do this, we need to
do a couple things:
1. Create a function that parses through our files and returns an array
of available blog posts.
2. Inject this array data into the home page (`index.js`) component. 

### Writing a utility for parsing the file structure
The goal of these utility functions is to parse through the project directory and organize blog post
files into an array. I use the front matter from my `mdx` files to get the blog post titles and
dates, and then I sort the posts by the date (because I want to display the posts index on the home page
in order from newest to oldest). 

I've chosen to house these functions in a new directory called `lib`, in a file called `utils.js`.
From the root of the project:
```shell script
mkdir lib
touch lib/utils.js
```

Then, I added the following to the body of `utils.js`
```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

const _getPostsFromPostTypeDirectory = (postsDirectory, dir) => {
  let files = [];
  let currentDirectory = path.join(postsDirectory, dir);
  let filesInDirectory = fs.readdirSync(currentDirectory).filter(d => d.includes('.md'))
  filesInDirectory.forEach(f => {
      let fileContents = fs.readFileSync(path.join(currentDirectory, f));
      const matterResult = matter(fileContents);
      let fileInfo = {
        fileName: f,
        ...matterResult.data,
        postType: dir,
        pid: f.replace(/\.mdx?$/, "")
      };
      files = [...files, fileInfo];
  });
  return files;
};

export function getSortedPostsData(dirname = null) {
  let postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "pages");
  let allPosts = [];
  // if no dirname is given, get all posts
  if (!dirname) {
    // get available directory names
    const allDirNames = fs
      .readdirSync(postsDirectory)
      .filter(d => !d.includes("."));
    // make a list of posts from all the posts directories
    allDirNames.forEach(dir => {
      // open directory
      let files = _getPostsFromPostTypeDirectory(postsDirectory, dir);
      if (!!files.length > 0) {
        allPosts = [...allPosts, ...files];
      }
    });
  } else {
    let files = _getPostsFromPostTypeDirectory(postsDirectory, dirname);
    if (!!files.length > 0) {
      allPosts = [...allPosts, ...files];
    }
  }
  // if dirname is given, use that name to get posts from that directory
  return allPosts.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.date < b.date) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  });
}
```

There's a lot going on here, so I'll give a cursory overview of each of these three functions:

### `_getPostsFromPostTypeDirectory`
This is a helper function that I will use in the main function `getSortedPostsData`. This function
takes two arguments, `postsDirectory` and `dir`. These two values are used to create a file path
that will be used to read files. For instance, the `pages` directory will
hold different types of posts, `blog` posts, maybe `project` posts, etc. Therefor,
the structure of `pages` could look like this:
```text
pages
├── blog
│   ├── blog_post_1.js
│   ├── first-post.mdx
│   ├── second-post.mdx
│   └── third-post.mdx
├── projects 
│   ├── first-project.js
│   ├── second-project.mdx
│   └── third-project.mdx
├── blog.js
├── index.js
├── projects.js
└── workflows.js
```

The files that I want to show up in my array are only the files in the `blog` and `project`
directories. Therefore, I need to get the directories in the `pages` directory,
and then iterate through each of these subdirectories to make a collection of 
the posts I'm interested in.

### `getSortedPostsData`
This function first gets the names of the directories we need to iterate through.
Then it uses the `_getPostsFromPostTypeDirectory` to get the front matter data
from these files. Finally, it will return the array of files in order from newest to oldest
based on the date in the front matter.


### Injecting the array of posts into `index.js` via `getStaticProps`
Okay, so I have a way of getting posts data based on the files available in my `pages` directory.
Now, it's time to inject this array into `index.js` as a prop in order to
display this array on the home page. NextJS offers a way to do this via
`getStaticProps`, a special NextJS function for injecting props into any page.

I can edit my `index.js` file to look like this:
```js {3,6,14-21}
import React from "react";
import OverviewLayout from "../components/page-layouts/OverviewLayout";
import { getSortedPostsData } from "../lib/utils";

const Home = props => {
  console.log(props);
  return (
    <OverviewLayout>
      <div>This is my home page!</div>
    </OverviewLayout>
  );
};

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const allPostsData = getSortedPostsData();
  return {
    props: {
      posts: allPostsData
    }
  };
}

export default Home;
```

On lines 14-21, I've added the `getStaticProps` function, and I've edited
the body of this function to use my `getSortedPostsData` utility. The data
returned by this utility function will be inected into `Home` via a prop
called `posts` (line 18). The `console.log` on line 6 will output the available
props for `Home`, so you can see the connection between the returned value of
`getSortedPostsData` and the props injected into the default export from this file,
a.k.a `Home`.

In order to display the array of posts on my home page, I'm going to use my
`PostOverview` component. The contents of `index.js` should look like this now:
```js
import React from "react";
import OverviewLayout from "../components/page-layouts/OverviewLayout";
import { getSortedPostsData } from "../lib/utils";
import PostOverview from "../components/styled-components/PostOverview";

const Home = props => {
  const { posts } = props;
  return (
    <OverviewLayout>
      {posts.map(p => (
        <PostOverview title={p.title} date={p.date} key={p.pid} />
      ))}
    </OverviewLayout>
  );
};

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const allPostsData = getSortedPostsData();
  return {
    props: {
      posts: allPostsData
    }
  };
}

export default Home;
```

The home page should now look like this, showing all of the posts we have in descending order by date:
<CenteredImage caption={"The new home page with nav bar"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-5/home_posts.png' 
        alt='`/` with posts' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

#### Make the post titles clickable links
As of right now, the posts should show up on the home page, but they aren't links. In order
to fix this, I'm going to turn the `PostTitle` into a link using the `Link` component build in
to NextJS:
```js {2,9-11}
// Text.js
export const PostTitle = ({ title, to }) => {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        font-size: 24px;
      `}
    >
      <Link href={to}>
        <a>{title}</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The highlighted lines have been changed to convert the post title into a link. However,
just changing the component here is not enough. We are now supplying a `to` prop to `PostTitle`
that will be used as the `href` attribute on the nav link. This means we need to add this as a
prop to `PostOverview` as well, so it can be passed through `PostOverview` to `PostTitle`:
```js {2,7}
// PostOverview.js
const PostOverview = ({ title, date, to }) => {
  return (
    <div css={css`
      height: 70px;
    `}>
      <PostTitle title={title} to={to}/>
      <DateLabel date={date} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Adding a routing address to our posts data
The last missing piece is to add data to our posts array (in `index.js`) that we can use
as the address to navigate to when a post is clicked on. In other words, we need to associate
each post in the array with a link to the address for that post. We can do this by using the `postType` and
`pid` data fields for each post in our post array to construct a route for each post link:
```js {11}
// index.js
const Home = props => {
  const { posts } = props;
  return (
    <OverviewLayout>
      {posts.map(p => (
        <PostOverview
          title={p.title}
          date={p.date}
          key={p.pid}
          to={`/${p.postType}/${p.pid}`}
        />
      ))}
    </OverviewLayout>
  );
};
``` 
In line 10, I've added a `to` prop that will connect each post with the route for that post page. Now,
clicking on a post title should take us to correct post!
