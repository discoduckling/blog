<div style={{color: 'blue'}}>Building a Next.js Blog: Part 6</div>

The basic site has been created, and everything is wired and ready to go. But how do we deploy
and share our new creation? The creators of Next.js have also created a platform called 
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) that works seamlessly with Next.js when it comes to deployment.
It's very easy to integrate with GitHub, which is the Git provider I will be using in this
example. Best of all, it's free. Even though it's free, Vercel has a rich feature set and getting
some exposure to the platform will help in the future if you ever want to use it for a more
involved project. 

### Getting set up with GitHub

When you initialize your app using `create-next-app`, it automatically sets up Git for the project.
Before continuing, make sure you've committed all of your changes to your `master` branch.


Now, it's just a question of pushing the project to a remote repo in GitHub (you could also use GitLab
or Bitbucket). The end goal is to set up a continuous deployment pipeline using GitHub and Vercel's
integration with GitHub to detect changes in the remote repo. When changes are detected on a feature branch
(i.e. `develop`), Vercel will deploy the site to a "preview" site. On the other hand, when changes
are detected on the `master` branch, Vercel will deploy the site to production.

#### Make a remote repo for the project

Once you have logged in to your account, make a new repo for your project. Here's an example of 
how I filled out the "new repository" form: 

import CenteredImage from "../../components/styled-components/CenteredImage"

<CenteredImage caption={"Creating a new repo"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/create_repo.png' 
        alt='Creating a new repo in GitHub' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

Once you've created your new GitHub repo, the next screen will show you directions for the
various ways to get your local directories linked to the remote repository you just
created. We already have a local directory, so follow the directions on pushing an 
existing directory to github:
```shell script {1}
git remote add origin https://github.com/discoduckling/example-blog.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Obviously, the URL in line 1 will be different for your repo. Line 2 is renaming 
the master branch (which should be your current branch since we haven't created any
feature branches yet) to `main` instead of `master`. Finally, in line 3, the local
repo on the (now) `main` branch is pushed to the remote repo.

#### Create branches
As I mentioned before, Vercel can detect changes on both the `main` branch other 
non-`main` branches, once Vercel is integrated with your remote repo. What's the
point of having non-`main` branches, like "feature" or `develop` branches? Having
a buffer between non-tested changes and a production site is a best practice 
because it allows a developer to test their changes on a deployed site to see
if the deployed changes match what they had in mind. Though most problems can 
be caught by just testing changes locally, i.e. visiting `localhost:3000` while
the Next.js app server is running, deployment can add unexpected behavior to the
app. Furthermore, deploying to a test site can also give devs the opportunity to
access the test site from different devices, allowing for even more robust
test cases. For my Next.js site, I found this particularly helpful when I was
working on styling for mobile. I could deploy my styling to a feature branch or
my `develop` branch and then access the site via my phone or tablet to get an idea
of what my changes look like on all the devices I had to test with.


For Next.js projects, I like to have at least two branches:
* `main`: this is the main or "master" branch, and changes here will be reflected on our production site
* `develop`: this is the last test stage before pushing to master

And then I'll have a feature branch, like `new-post` or `mobile-header`. The workflow will
look something like this:

<CenteredImage caption={"Workflow Overview"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/git_workflow.png' 
        alt='Worfkow Overview' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

For now, just create a `develop` branch locally and push the branch to
your remote repo. We can use the `develop`
branch to test deploying changes to a preview site before deploying to production.

```shell script
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

### Getting set up with Vercel
First, create a new (free) account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Once your account has been created, you can import a project.

<CenteredImage caption={"Import a new project into Vercel"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/import_project.png' 
        alt='Import a new project into Vercel' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

Continue by choosing to import an existing GitHub project:

<CenteredImage caption={"Import the existing GitHub project"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/vercel_github_import.png' 
        alt='Import the existing GitHub project' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

Then, copy and paste your GitHub repo's url into this dialog (see? super easy integration):

<CenteredImage caption={"Paste in your GitHub repo URL to import the project"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/import_url.png' 
        alt='Paste GitHub repo URL to import project' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "75%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

In the next screen, you can set up some project config options if there is something
specific you'd like to tweak. I didn't tweak anything for this project:

<CenteredImage caption={"No extra config needed for this project"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/project_settings.png' 
        alt='No extra config needed for this project' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "75%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

After you click "Deploy", this pretty cool screen comes up where it displays
the progress of the deployment:

<CenteredImage caption={"Building the project"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/building_project.png' 
        alt='Building the project' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>


You can now visit your production site!

### A walkthrough of the Vercel dashboard
If you go to your Vercel home page, you will see your Vercel dashboard. Here's an example of mine: 

<CenteredImage caption={"My Vercel dashboard"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/vercel_dashboard.png' 
        alt='My Vercel dashboard' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

The example project I _just_ deployed is `example-blog`. The left half of the dashboard displays
all of your Vercel projects, while the right side shows any recent deployments or Vercel-related
activity for your projects. 

In the info box for `example-blog`, we see the URLs for the production version of our site. You
can also click the `Visit` button, and it will open a new tab with the production site. By clicking
on `example-blog`, you will head to the details page for this project. Here, you'll find a preview
of the production deployment as well as the preview deployments. I currently have no preview
deployments because I have only pushed to my `main` branch (which Vercel considers the production
branch). In the next section, we'll make changes to the site and push the changes to `develop`, and this
should trigger a preview deployment. 

### Walking through the workflow for making changes 
For the preview deployment, the change I will be making is adding a new post.

#### Test changes locally
First, create a new branch, which I'll call `new-post`.

```shell script
git checkout -b new-post
```

Then, create the new post. From the root directory of the project:
```shell script
touch pages/blog/fourth-post.mdx
```

Next, populate the new post with some content. I'm just going to add some basic content for now:

```markdown
---
title: 'My fourth post'
layout: 'BlogPostLayout'
date: '2020-11-01'
---

This is a new post to test deploying via Vercel.
```

Now, let's test these changes by running the project locally:
```markdown
npm run dev
```

Cool, it looks like the changes look okay locally:
<CenteredImage caption={"Testing out a new post"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/new_test_post.png' 
        alt='Testing out a new post' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>


#### Commit the changes and merge them into `develop` 
Since the changes look okay locally, I feel confident enough to commit them
and merge the changes from `new-post` into `develop`.

```shell script
git add pages/*
git commit -m "Create my fourth post"
git checkout develop
git merge new-post
```

At this point, you could test the changes out locally again for peace of mind.
I'm being impatient, so I'm going to fast forward and push these changes
to my remote `develop` branch:
```shell script
git push origin develop
```

#### Monitor the deployment online
After you push your changes to the remote `develop` branch, you can actually
get a glimpse of the deployment status on your repo page:
<CenteredImage caption={"Our preview deployment is pending"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/pending_preview.png' 
        alt='Our preview deployment is pending' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "50%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

Back on the Vercel dashboard for this project, once the preview deployment is ready,
you'll see some info under `Preview Deployments`:
<CenteredImage caption={"Vercel's preview deployment info"}>
    <img src='/next-js-dev-part-6/vercel_preview.png' 
        alt='Vercel preview deployment dashboard' 
        style={{
            maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
</CenteredImage>

#### Testing out the changes
Now, if you navigate to your preview deployment site, you should see the fourth
post listed there. Clicking on it should show the sparse content of the post.
In a separate tab, navigate to the production site for your project. The fourth
post should not be visible on the production site because we haven't pushed
these new changes to `main`. If you're ready to deploy your new post to production,
merge in `develop` into `main`, and Vercel will take care of the rest!
